## Tagging
Tags are named references that don't move with new commits. They represent a
snapshot of the project at the time of the tagging.

- Lightweight tags for local snapshots
- Annotated tags for official releases

### Details

Lightweight tags are files storing the reference to an object. Annotated 
tags are git objects with meta-information such as the author, the tag date 
and the reference to the tagged object.
